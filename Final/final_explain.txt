Cell 1 - imports

Cell 2 - segmentation try 1 with supporting functions 
	(returns original image with boxes, thresholded image with boxes and points of interest used in watershed)

cell 3 - segmentation try 2

cell 4 - segmentation try 3
	(returns thresholded frame)

cell 5 - find centroid used in segmentation try 1

cell 6 - tracking class

cell 7 - draw_line() to simply draw trajectory path

cell 8 - Main

4 sections

Uncomment any one of the starting 3 to try out segmentation. Try 2 still in progress.

section 4 - use of tracking class.



Tracking class explanation
4 main sections

init() - parameters 
	objectid - start with 1
	disappeared counter for deregistering cell against maxdisappeared (set to 10)

register() 
	register cell and initialise speed time distance info

deregister()
	deregister object id for later use

update() -  control flow as follows

	if 0 centroids provided in present frame, increases disappeared counter and deregister if exceeds maxdisappeared
	
	if 0 objects being tracked in previous frame, register all objects

	if objects being tracked in previous frame, take distance between centres in N - 1 and N frame
	(objectcentroids correspond to centroids in N - 1 frame)
	(inputcentroids correspond to centroids in N frame)

	create usedrows and usedcols set to mark cells tagged as same in consecutive frames
	(row correspond to objectCentroids)
	(col correspond to inputCentroids)
	Explanation: If row and col not observed.......transfer object id from row(objectCentroids) to col(inputCentroids) and initialize dissapearing counter
	
	2 conditions arise:	[D.shape[0] >= D.shape[1]]
	if objectcentroids > = input centroids. We look for dissapearing cells, increase counter and check for deregister

	If objectCentroids < input centroids. We register new cells



NOTE -- to run segmentation try 3. check cell 8 and make sure order while plotting is (int(centroid[0]),int(centroid[1]))
	ie. cv2.putText and cv2.circle
	variable - frame
